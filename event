            <h2>Message from the PTA President</h2>
            <p>Apparently, the PTA did not get the safety message regarding construction           and alcohol….we are ready to get this party started in the building zone! Grab a            beverage and spend like a construction tycoon. We may not be selling bulldozers,            but there are plenty of outstanding items to choose from. </p> 

        <p>This night is the highlight of PTA fundraising activities and allows you to play         a primary role in supporting every child at Clermont and have some fun at the same          time! Mingle with your neighbors, sip some wine with your child’s room parent, or           get to know some of our excellent Clermont teachers and staff outside the realm             of the classroom. </p>

        <p><img src="img/pta%20at%20work.jpg" class="pta" width="500"/>There are many volunteer construction workers that have labored overtime to              build this auction. They not only grabbed a hard-hat, but they may have been seen           with a reflective vest and some steel-toed boots as well. These dedicated people            were led by a couple of outstanding project managers and co-chairs, Dee Dee                 Denton and Nicole Olsen. With the help of their board liaison and vice                  president, Kate Seward, and board secretary, Jennifer Jones, they have worked very          hard to provide us with an experience we won’t forget! </p>

 
        <p>Thanks to all of our sponsors and auction item donors, who have made this a              truly wonderful auction. An extra thanks to the teachers and staff who donated              experiences and activities as auction items. These are always wildly popular and            give our children an opportunity to connect with their teachers outside of the              classroom. </p>

        <p>I look forward to enjoying this evening with you. Enjoy the food, drink, and         wonderful company of the rest of the Clermont community. Bid early, bid often, and put      on that hard hat, because it may get dirty! </p>

 

            <p>Warm Regards, <br /><i>Kathy Off <br />PTA President</i>
